		This is where individual Sparks are displayed, along with Jots, which are identical to Sparks as a data construct, except that each Jot is tied to a Spark. Reminders are available as well. Most of the Javascript related to building the page on load is written into the HTML, while the code for parsing Jot and Reminder input is in spark_page.js
